# Levels Configuration File

# 60 x 20 bricks = 19 bricks per row
# I haven't tried out different brick sizes besides these two.
# You can play around with it and if you encounter bugs let me know :)
# Make sure the layout rows are all the same length for each level!
#     e.g. levels with 120x40 bricks should have rows of length 10, 
#          60x20 bricks should have rows of length 19.

# brickWidth and brickHeight are in pixels, must be positive numbers and 
# should end in .0

# The total number of levels
totalLevels = 4

# If you add levels, the section MUST be named level_NUMBER
