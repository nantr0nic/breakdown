## WIP
First prototype of an SFML game made with [SFML 3 Game Template](https://www.github.com/nantr0nic/sfml3-game-template/).

*   [**EnTT**](https://github.com/skypjack/entt): For the ECS architecture.
*   [**toml++**](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus): For parsing TOML configuration files.
