# I couldn't get CMake to properly detect and enable C++23 Modules support with MSVC, #
# but this toolchain file was **SUPPOSED** to fix that. It didn't. I'm saving this to #
# play around with later. Until then, 'import std' will remain a fantasy -- at least  #
# with MSVC (and CMake) 🙄                                                            #
